									<p style="color:20262E">My name is <B>Jeff Bryle G. Reyes</B>, <I>21yrs old and
									currently living in Tagbilaran City Bohol</i>. I live my life
									as a simple guy, I do what I have to do(schoolworks,
									home responsibilities, etc...) and try to live my life as
									I like and as to what I stand and believe in. I may be
									intimidating to look at and maybe because of how I
									look generally to people. I am also a very quiet and
									reserve person but do not misunderstand me, I am a
									good person(I promise),also the quote that I
									always follow is "Be kind, good, and helpful to
									people, and all of it will come back to you" it's a
									quote that I made for myself.</p>
									<p>
									<img src="yeye.jpg" style="width:auto;height:160px; float:right; margin:10px">
									<p>Being a game creator/developer excites me, the
									idea of creating a world and giving it life for
									people/players to enjoy gives me motivation to take
									a coding certificate. I guess that's all about who I
									am,... Thank you ....</p>
